# Knowledge-Economy-and-Economic-growth


This project empirically assess the effect of several  KE dimensions on economic growth. For that purpose, we use a sample of African and emerging countries. One of the challenges is to impute the large number of missing values, particularly, corresponding to proxy variables for innovation output (patents, and trademarks). We will employ dynamic panel data models to estimate the causal effect of KE on economic growth.
